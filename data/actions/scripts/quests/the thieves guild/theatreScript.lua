You may not fear for your own life, but how about hers!?\n\n2nd Knave: Oh no! Look! It's Princess Buttercup! He\'s holding her hostage!\n\nDoctor Darkness: Indeed I do! Wouldn\'t it be a pity for such a beautiful young lady to die so tragically?\n\nPrincess Buttercup: Don\'t care about me! Save the world!\n\nDoctor Darkness: Keep quiet! Else your hair will make the acquaintance of these scissors!\n\nAll: You\'re such a monster!\n\nDoctor Darkness: Hahaha!

It\'s Lucky, the wonder dog!\n\nLucky: Woof! Woof!\n\nDoctor Darkness: Noooooo!\n\nKnight Brave: Get him, boy!\n\nLucky: Grrr!\n\nDoctor Darkness: Ahhhhhh!\n\nAll: Hooray!\n\nKnight Brave: Lucky, once again you saved the day!\n\nLucky: Woof!")
